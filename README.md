# Meeting_3

1. Introduction to Arduino 3
- Developing knowledge in Arduino

2. Project to Do
- RGB LED Project
  - Build a circuit with RGB LED
  - Present the S.O.S Distress Signal by using loops
  - Present a RGB spectrum
 
3. Goals
- Learn the concept of RGB
- Learn the construction of a RGB LED
- Learn to write functions in Arduino
  - Different types of function
  - Create a function
- Learn about loops in Arduino
  - for-loop
  - while-loop
  - do-while-loop
- Try digital RGB LED combinations and use loops to present the S.O.S Distress Signal
- Learn about analog I/O (The principle is related to PWM, which we will not be covered in this meeting but it will be coverd in future meetings)
  - Try different analog RGB LED combinations
  - Create a function to optimize the code
- Learn to write codes to present a RGB spectrum
  - Hint: Use loops

4. Other Ways to Present a RGB spectrum (Advanced)
- Is there other way to present a RGB spectrum?
- Checkout RGBLed series 6 and 7, and see if you can understand the logic behind. Please Feel free to discuss them with your friends.
  - RGBLed 6.0, 6.1, and 6.2 demonstrate another way to present a RGB spectrum by passing RGB values to a function
  - RGBLed 7.0, 7.1, and 7.2 demonstrate another way to present a RGB spectrum by changing the output pins to a function
- Try to think about the following questions if you understand RGBLed series 6 and 7
  - Can you understand the differenes between these two? (Please make references to the statements above)
  - What are the differences between these two and the other one? Which one do you like the best?
- If you have any thought, let me know
